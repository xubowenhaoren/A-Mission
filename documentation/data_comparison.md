### Comparing E-mission motion inference with actual pre-defined trips

#### 17th Avenue Northeast - Nagle Place

Start: 17th Avenue Northeast [-122.3093726,47.6652967]

End: Nagle Place [-122.319629,47.6157063]

Josh’s analysis: This one is weird. It should be multiple trips, and I'm not sure why it was collapsed into one.
1. I walked from the start location on 17th avenue to Denny Hall on campus, then manually ended my trip. That should be a trip with one segment that is walking.
2. Then I manually started another trip, and walked to the bus stop between the HUB and Padelford Hall. I waited for bus 372, and then I rode that two stops to the southern end of campus, before walking the further distance to the Husky Stadium. Then I manually ended the trip. This should be a trip with 3 segments. Walking from Denny to the bus stop, then riding the bus two stops, then walking to husky stadium.
3. I then manually started another trip. I then boarded the light rail, and rode it one stop to the Capitol Hill Station. I got  off near the corner of Cal Anderson Park, and walked south through the park. I ended my trip manually near the southern end of the park, near where this recorded trip ends. This trip should be 2 segments, the first being the light rail, and the second being the walk through the park.

Start: Nagle Place [-122.319629,47.6157063]

End: Broadway [-122.3208208,47.6150985]

Josh’s analysis: This is oddly what the first segment of my fourth pre-defined trip ought to be. I walked from the end of the previous trip to a bus stop. I waited there for like ten minutes before hopping on the first hill street car, where I rode up to the Capitol Hill Link Station. When I got there I noticed that my trip had automatically ended, so I restarted another trip once I got there. Seems like the trip was ended automatically at the bus stop. The data here is mostly accurate but with unintended start/stop points, and we lost the first hill streetcar data.

Start: Broadway [-122.3208208,47.6150985]

End: Pike Street [-122.3351995,47.6111248]

Josh’s analysis: Most of this one is me riding the light rail one stop from the Capitol Hill Station. When I reached the next stop, I walked a block to the BECU, then manually ended the trip, so this should have two segments.

End: 1st Avenue Northeast [-122.3283385,47.6610683]

Josh’s analysis: In this one I exactly followed my last pre-defined trip. The first segment looks good. The second segment ought to be broken up into two separate segments. I rode bus route 10 to the Capitol hill light rail station, and then I rode the light rail to the husky stadium. The next segment is good, I walked to the bus stop across the street from the husky stadium. Then I rode the bus (I think route 45) from that bus stop to 50th street, and then walked back to my car which is where I started the first trip (after driving to Seattle).
